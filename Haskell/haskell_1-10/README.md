## Haskell Euler Solutions

### Compile and Run

All the Haskell problems are able to be compiled using `ghc` 
(glasgow-haskell-compiler).  With the help of a top-level global `Makefile`
run the follow command:

    $> make problem="Euler_7"

this will compile `Euler.hs` creating the executable `Euler_7`.

### Clean

Just simple, run:

    $> make clean

this will clean up the directory of all the object files and itermediaries.
